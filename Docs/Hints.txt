Packages:
RxJs seems to have a Bug in the newer version, so we leave it at 5.0.0-beta.12

Barrels:
SystemJS doesnt seem to recognize index.ts by default, so we currently add it everywhere, or we need to keep track of all index.ts in the systemjs-config

Errors:
(SystemJS) Unexpected token <
--> Since SystemJS doesn't know Barrels without index, missing the /index is one of the reasons to cause this error
