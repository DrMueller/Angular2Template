Folder-Structure guide 
https://angular.io/styleguide --> "Here is a compliant folder and file structure"

Style-Guide Brainstorming:
- Every Components consists a html, ts and less file
- Every Feature (direct Folder under the app one) has it's own module, routing and barrel (index.ts)
- Every Sub-Feature has it's own barrel
- Every folder and file-name in the app-section is writtien in lower case
- instead of camel case, - can be used for better readability
- Observables only in Services, otherwise Promises (According to Ward Bell), except if a stream is in fact needed

Routing:
- The most specific Routes should always come before the more general ones
